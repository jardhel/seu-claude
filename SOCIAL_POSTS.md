### Main Launch Tweet
```
🚀 Just released seu-claude v1.0.0

Local Codebase RAG for Claude Code that actually works:

✅ AST-based semantic chunking (not naive text splitting)
✅ ~100MB RAM idle (vs 35GB+ competitors)  
✅ 100% local - your code never leaves your machine
✅ Works with Claude Code & Desktop

npm i -g seu-claude

### Thread (Optional)
```
🧵 Why I built seu-claude:

1/ Current AI memory plugins suffer from "goldfish memory" - they only remember files the AI touched

2/ Most use in-memory vector DBs that eat 35GB+ RAM

3/ seu-claude proactively indexes your ENTIRE codebase with AST-aware chunking

4/ Uses LanceDB (disk-based) + Transformers.js (local embeddings)

Result: Full semantic search in ~100MB RAM 🎯

🚀 Excited to announce seu-claude v1.0.0 - my open-source contribution to the Claude AI ecosystem!

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺:
Current memory plugins for Claude Code suffer from "goldfish memory" - they only remember files the AI has touched, use 35GB+ RAM, and have complex Python dependencies.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
seu-claude implements proactive semantic indexing - your entire codebase is parsed, understood, and made searchable BEFORE Claude even asks.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀:
🧠 AST-based chunking with Tree-sitter (understands code structure)
💾 ~100MB RAM idle (LanceDB zero-copy architecture)
🔒 100% local processing (Transformers.js - no data leaves your machine)
⚡ Native MCP integration for Claude Code & Desktop

𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸:
• Node.js 20+ (no Python dependencies)
• Tree-sitter (multi-language AST parsing)
• LanceDB (disk-based vector storage)
• Transformers.js (local embeddings)

Try it now:
npm install -g seu-claude

GitHub: https://github.com/jardhel/seu-claude
npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/seu-claude

I'd love feedback from developers using Claude Code!

Show HN: seu-claude – Local RAG for Claude Code with AST-based chunking (~100MB RAM)
```

### Post
```
Hey HN!

I built seu-claude to solve the "goldfish memory" problem with Claude Code's memory plugins.

The problem: Most RAG solutions for coding assistants only remember files the AI has touched, use in-memory vector DBs (35GB+ RAM), and require Python with CUDA dependencies.

My solution:
- Proactive indexing of your entire codebase
- AST-based semantic chunking using Tree-sitter (not naive text splitting)
- LanceDB for disk-based vector storage (~100MB RAM idle)
- Transformers.js for 100% local embeddings
- Pure Node.js - no Python dependencies

It works as an MCP server for Claude Code and Claude Desktop.

Install: npm i -g seu-claude

Tech stack: TypeScript, Tree-sitter (WASM), LanceDB, Transformers.js (Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

GitHub: https://github.com/jardhel/seu-claude

Would love feedback, especially from developers who've struggled with memory/context in AI coding assistants!

**Title:** `[Tool] seu-claude v1.0.0 - Local RAG for Claude Code with ~100MB RAM footprint`

```
Just released seu-claude, an MCP server that gives Claude Code semantic understanding of your entire codebase.

**Why I built this:**
- Existing memory plugins only remember files Claude has touched
- In-memory vector DBs use 35GB+ RAM
- I wanted something lightweight that indexes proactively

**What it does:**
- AST-based chunking (understands functions, classes, not just text)
- ~100MB RAM idle (LanceDB disk-based storage)
- 100% local (Transformers.js embeddings)
- Works with Claude Code and Claude Desktop

**Install:**
```
npm i -g seu-claude
```

**GitHub:** https://github.com/jardhel/seu-claude

Happy to answer questions!

### r/LocalLLaMA

**Title:** `seu-claude: Local codebase RAG with 100% offline embeddings (Transformers.js)`

```
Released v1.0.0 of seu-claude - a local RAG solution for Claude Code that runs entirely offline.

**Key for this sub:**
- Uses Transformers.js with Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- ALL embedding happens locally - no API calls
- ~100MB RAM idle (LanceDB disk-based vectors)
- No Python/CUDA needed - pure Node.js

It's an MCP server that gives Claude Code semantic search over your codebase.

The AST-based chunking is the interesting part - it uses Tree-sitter to understand code structure, so chunks are semantically meaningful (whole functions, classes) rather than arbitrary text splits.

npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/seu-claude

Would love feedback on the local embedding approach!
